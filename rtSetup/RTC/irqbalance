# MagAO-X irqbalance configuration for RTC
#
# Edit the IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS bitmask to match the r/t cpusets created in make_cpusets
#
# Edit the irqbalance_policyscript to include IRQs to ban
# 
# To Install:
#
# If first time after new installation: $ cp /etc/sysconfig/irqbalance /etc/sysconfig/irqbalance.bup
#
# $ systemctl stop irqbalance
#
# Then start irqbalance:
# $ systemctl start irqbalance
# $ systemctl status irqbalance
# 

# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems. The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds. This is the environment file that is specified to systemd via the
# EnvironmentFile key in the service unit file (or via whatever method the init
# system you're using has.
#
# ONESHOT=yes
# after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
# load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
# it again.
#IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT=

#
# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
# bitmask which allows you to indicate which cpu's should
# be skipped when reblancing irqs. Cpu numbers which have their
# corresponding bits set to one in this mask will not have any
# irq's assigned to them on rebalance
#
# For RTC this is 128 bits.  Currently bans 32-63 and 96-127 (which are the h/t pairs)
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPULIST=32-63,96-127

#
# IRQBALANCE_ARGS
# append any args here to the irqbalance daemon as documented in the man page
#
# Banning IDs by matching in the scripts
IRQBALANCE_ARGS=--policyscript=/usr/local/bin/irqbalance_policyscript

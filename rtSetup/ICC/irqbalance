# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems. The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds. This is the environment file that is specified to systemd via the
# EnvironmentFile key in the service unit file (or via whatever method the init
# system you're using has.

# ONESHOT=yes
# after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
# load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
# it again.

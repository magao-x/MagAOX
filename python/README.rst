Python utilities for MagAO-X interface
======================================

This is the home for Python components of the system that depend on specific
details of how MagAO-X is implemented and thus should evolve in lockstep
with the rest of the system.

The top-level Makefile installs the package ``magaox`` into the current active
Python interpreter's environment using an editable install, so edits in the
source tree are immediately reflected when processes are restarted.

# The MagAOX Software System

This is the software which runs the MagAOX ExAO system.

## 1 Dependencies

#### 1.1 Current:
1. mxlib (https://github.com/jaredmales/mxlib)
2. libudev (for introspective device discovery)
3. zlib (compression for INDI)
   - zlib-devel [centOS-7]
   - zlib1g-dev [ubuntu]

#### 1.1 Future
1. libhdf5 (though not for anything currently implemented, but we will)

## 2 Software Configuration

For a standard build, nothing needs to be done here.  However, various defaults can be changed with macros.  To override at build time, the following macros can be redefined in `local/config.mk` [how?]

#### 2.1 Environment Variables

These are defined in `libMagAOX/common/environment.hpp`.  They do not need to be set, but can be used to override relevant defaults.

- `MAGAOX_env_path`, the name of the environment variable holding the base path to the MagAOX system directories.  Default = "MagAOX_PATH"

- `MAGAOX_env_config`, the name of the environment variable holding the relative path to the config files.  Default = "MagAOX_CONFIG".

#### 2.2 Default Values

These are values which might be changed for different components. These are defined in `libMagAOX/common/defaults.hpp`.  They do not normally need to be changed, but these macros can be used to override relevant defaults.

`MAGAOX_default_writePause`

`MAGAOX_default_max_logSize`

`MAGAOX_default_loopPause`

#### 2.3 Config Values

These are values which should change for all components of MagAO-X.  These are defined in `libMagAOX/common/config.hpp`.  They do not normally need to be changed for a typical build, but these macros can be used to override relevant defaults.

`MAGAOX_logExt`

`MAGAOX_RT_SCHED_POLICY` is the real-time scheduling policy.  The result is `SCHED_FIFO`.

#### 2.4 Paths

These are defined in `libMagAOX/common/paths.hpp`.  They do not normally need to be changed, but these macros can be used to override the relevant defaults.

- `MAGAOX_path` The path to the MagAO-X system files This directory will have subdirectories including config, log, and sys directories.

- `MAGAOX_configRelPath` This is the subdirectory for configuration files.

- `MAGAOX_globalConfig` The filename for the global configuration file. Will be looked for in the config/ subdirectory.

- `MAGAOX_logRelPath` This is the subdirectory for logs.

- `MAGAOX_sysRelPath` This is the subdirectory for the system status files.

- `MAGAOX_secretsRelPath` This is the subdirectory for secrets.

- `MAGAOX_driverRelPath` This is the subdirectory for the INDI drivers.

- `MAGAOX_driverFIFORelPath` This is the subdirectory for the INDI driver FIFOs.

## 3 Building

A rudimentary build system has been implemented.

To build an app, cd to the app's directory and type
```
make -f ../../Make/magAOXApp.mk t=<appname>
```
replacing `appname` with the name of the application.

To build a utility, cd to the utility's directory and type
```
make -f ../../Make/magAOXUtil.mk t=<utilname>
```
replacing `utilname` with the name of the utility.

The difference between the two Makefiles is in install, in that MagAO-X Applications get setuid, whereas the utilities do not.

Some notes:

* libMagAOX (part of this repository) is a c++ header-only library.  It is compiled into a pre-compiled-header (PCH), managed by the build system.  Any changes to libMagAOX should trigger a re-compile of the PCH, and of any apps depending on it.

* Allowing setuid for RT priority handling, access to ttys and FIFOs, etc., requires hardcoding LD_LIBRARY_PATH at build time.  This is done in the makefiles, and so should be transparent.

* Install requires root privileges.

ToDo:
- [] Use environment variables for path to various parts of build system, path to libMagAOX PCH, etc.
- [] Possibly use name of directory for target app name.

## 4 Software Install

The following are the default MagAOX system directories.

```
/opt/MagAOX               [MagAOX system directory]
/opt/MagAOX/bin           [Contains all applications]
/opt/MagAOX/drivers
/opt/MagAOX/drivers/fifos
/opt/MagAOX/config        [Contains the configuration files for the applications]
/opt/MagAOX/logs          [Directory where logs are written by the applications] (chown :xlog, chmod g+w, chmod g+s)
/opt/MagAOX/sys           [Directory for application status files, e.g. PID lock-files]
/opt/MagAOX/secrets       [Directory containing device passwords, etc.]
```

 This directory structure is #define-ed in libMagAOX/common/defaults.hpp.  It is created, with the proper permissions, by the script `setup/makeDirs.sh`.  It is also specified in `local/config.mk`.  Changing this isn't yet very simple, but we intend for it to be possible to have parallel installations.

ToDo:
- [] Investigate using appropriate environment variables to allow overriding these.
- [] Investigate having the defines be passed in via make.  E.g. `-DMAGAOX_path=/opt/MagAOX-DEV` will override, maybe we should just inherit from `local/config.mk`

On install, symlinks are made for executables from `/usr/local/bin` to `/opt/MagAOX/bin`.

## 5 Documentation

The code is more-or-less carefully documented with doxygen

- [] Complete doxygen doc system
- [] Script construction of complete docs from various places (doxygen, and the markdown app docs)
- [] Create system to automatically make c.l. option table for each app
- [] Decide: do we use github pages, or host it on one of the snazzy magao-x domains?

## 6 To-Do

To-do items are listed in the above sections.  Also see the Todo page in the doxygen html.  Other misc. items below:

- [] split base INDI off into separate repo, which will be the minimum someone needs to have INDI utils for interacting with MagAO-X without installing the whole tree.
- [] create indiserver startup script which takes a list of drivers from a config file, creates symlinks to xindidriver as needed, and then starts indiserver itself.
- [] start issue tracking

## 7 Develop in a VM with [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)

The MagAOX code is intimately tied to Linux OS internals, and targets CentOS 7 for the realtime control computers. To develop in the most "flight-like" configuration, a Vagrantfile is provided to set up a development VM.

### Prerequisites:

  * VirtualBox
  * Vagrant
  * NFS

### Usage:

After cloning the MagAOX repository, `cd` into it and run `vagrant up`. Vagrant will download a virtual machine image for CentOS 7 and then set up all the dependencies required. NFS is used to sync the contents of your repository clone to the VM.

To connect to the VM, use `vagrant ssh`.
